For language pairs that\\nare both low-resource and from different families\\n(e.g., Romanian ,Chinese), the performance gap\\ncan be further enlarged (Wang et al., 2022b). Since\\nChatGPT handles different tasks in one model, low-\\nresource translation tasks not only compete with\\nhigh-resource translation tasks (Jiao et al., 2022a),\\nbut also with other NLP tasks for the model capac-\\nity, which explains their poor performance.', metadata={'source': 'files/Is ChatGPT A Good Translator?

We explore an interesting\\nstrategy named Pivot Prompting to improve the\\ntranslation quality between distant languages.\\nSpeciﬁcally, we ask ChatGPT to translate the\\nsource sentence into a high-resource pivot language\\n(i.e., English by default) ﬁrst and then into the tar-\\nget language. We adjust the TP3prompt as below:\\nPlease provide the [PIV]\\ntranslation first and then the\\n[TGT] translation for these\\nsentences one by one:\\nwhere [PIV] denotes the pivot language. As a\\nlarge language model, ChatGPT will naturally con-\\ndition on both the prompt and the translation result\\nin the pivot language to generate the translation\\ninto the target language.
